Threat and vulnerability management
===============================================================

Vulnerability intelligence is just one stage in the vulnerability management lifecycle. Where many organisations
fall flat is having a vulnerability intelligence program without an actionable vulnerability management strategy â€“
or vice versa.

When it comes to building a threat intelligence and vulnerability management strategy, there are a few best practices
to get started: Plan ahead with room for flexibility; Understand threat priorities; *Strategically* patch and apply
updates.
