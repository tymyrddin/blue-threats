# D3FEND

D3FEND (Detection, Denial, and Disruption Framework Empowering Network Defense) is a _knowledge graph of cybersecurity countermeasures."_

It is still in beta and is funded by the Cybersecurity Directorate of the NSA and provides 
information on what is the technique (definition), how the technique works (how it works), things to think about 
when implementing the technique (considerations), and how to use the technique (example).

As with other MITRE resources, you can filter based on the ATT&CK matrix.
