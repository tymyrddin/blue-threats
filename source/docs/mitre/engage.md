# ENGAGE

_"[MITRE Engage](https://engage.mitre.org/) is a framework for planning and discussing adversary engagement operations that empowers you to engage your adversaries and achieve your cybersecurity goals."_

MITRE Engage is considered an Adversary Engagement Approach. This is accomplished by the implementation of Cyber 
Denial and Cyber Deception. With Cyber Denial we prevent the adversary's ability to conduct their operations and with Cyber Deception we 
intentionally plant artifacts to mislead the adversary. 

The Engage website provides a [starter kit](https://engage.mitre.org/starter-kit/) to get you 'started' with the 
Adversary Engagement Approach. The starter kit is a collection of whitepapers and PDFs explaining various checklists, 
methodologies, and processes to get you started.
