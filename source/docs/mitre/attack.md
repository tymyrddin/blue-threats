# ATT&CK® framework

The [ATT&CK® (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge) framework](https://attack.mitre.org/) is a 
globally-accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations. The ATT&CK 
knowledge base is used as a foundation for the development of specific threat models and methodologies in the private 
sector, in government, and in the cybersecurity product and service community.

In 2013, MITRE began to address the need to record and document common TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that 
APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) groups used against enterprise Windows networks. This started with an internal project 
known as FMX (Fort Meade Experiment). Within this project, selected security professionals were tasked to emulated 
adversarial TTPs against a network, and data was collected from the attacks on this network. The gathered data helped 
construct the beginning pieces of what we know today as the ATT&CK® framework.

The ATT&CK® framework has grown and expanded throughout the years. One notable expansion was that the framework 
focused solely on the Windows platform but has expanded to cover other platforms, such as macOS and Linux. The 
framework is heavily contributed to by many sources, such as security researchers and threat intelligence reports. 
Note this is not only a tool for blue teamers. The tool is also useful for red teamers.

The ATT&CK Matrix can be used to map a threat group to their tactics and techniques. There are several methods the 
search can be initiated.

## ATT&CK® Matrix

1. Goto to the bottom of the page to view the ATT&CK® Matrix for Enterprise. Across the top of the matrix, there are 14 
categories. Each category contains the techniques an adversary could use to perform the tactic. The categories cover 
the seven-stage Cyber Attack Lifecycle (Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain).
2. Under Initial Access, there are 9 techniques. Some techniques have sub-techniques, such as Phishing.
3. Click on the gray bar to the right to view the sub-techniques.
4. Click on the technique or sub-technique.

## ATT&CK® Navigator

The same data can be viewed via the ATT&CK® Navigator: 

_"The ATT&CK® Navigator is designed to provide basic navigation and annotation of ATT&CK® matrices, something that people are already doing today in tools like Excel. We've designed it to be simple and generic - you can use the Navigator to visualize your defensive coverage, your red/blue team planning, the frequency of detected techniques, or anything else you want to do."_

1. Access the Navigator view when visiting a group or tool page.
2. In the sub-menu select view.
