# Feeds

Feeds are resources that contain indicators that can be imported into MISP and provide attributed information about security events. These feeds provide analysts and organisations with continuously updated information on threats and adversaries and aid in their proactive defence against attacks.

MISP Feeds provide a way to:

* Exchange threat information.
* Preview events along with associated attributes and objects.
* Select and import events to your instance.
* Correlate attributes identified between events and feeds.

Feeds are enabled and managed by the Site Admin for the analysts to obtain information on events and indicators.
