# Introduction

## What?

Yet Another Ridiculous Acronym (Yara) was developed by Victor M. Alvarez ([@plusvic](https://twitter.com/plusvic)) and 
[@VirusTotal](https://twitter.com/virustotal), and is a tool aimed at (but not limited to) helping malware 
researchers to identify and classify malware samples. 

## Why?

Yara can identify information based on both binary and textual patterns, such as hexadecimal and strings contained 
within a file. It can be used in combination with [many other useful tools](https://github.com/InQuest/awesome-yara).
